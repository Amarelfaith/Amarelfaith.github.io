    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      This bread pudding recipe is unique because it uses buttery croissant
      rolls instead of the traditional day-old French bread. The mix of
      chocolate and toffee is amazing with the rich custard sauce added just
      before serving
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
      <li>10 large croissants, torn into pieces</li>

      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 cup toffee baking bits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        9x13-inch baking pan.
      </li>
      <li>Place pecans on a baking sheet.</li>
      <li>
        Toast pecans in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 8 minutes.
        Remove from oven and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F
        (165 degrees C)
      </li>
      <li>
        Place torn croissants into the prepared baking pan. Pour milk over bread
        and let soak for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a
        medium bowl using an electric mixer. Pour over bread mixture, blending
        well, using your hands if needed. Add toasted pecans, chocolate chips,
        and toffee bits. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the center is cooked through and top is
        golden brown, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        While bread pudding is baking, bring sugar, half-and-half, and butter to
        a boil in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.
        Reduce heat and let custard simmer for 5 minutes.
      </li>

        Remove custard from heat and let cool slightly. Pour in vanilla extract
        and stir well.
      </li>
