    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I love meatloaf, but not as much as I love meatloaf sandwiches. In fact,
      I'll make a meatloaf just for the leftovers. I'll fry the cold slice in a
      buttered pan until hot and crusty, and enjoy it on toast with ketchup.
      This recipe is basically that, plus bacon, in burger form.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>pinch dried thyme</li>
      <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
      <li>⅔ cup chopped cooked bacon</li>
      <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (85% lean)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, brown sugar, onion
        powder, garlic powder, thyme, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add
        breadcrumbs and chopped cooked bacon. Crumble in the ground beef. Mix
        with your fingers until bacon and breadcrumbs are distributed evenly
      </li>
      <li>
        Form mixture into 4 burgers with your wet hands. Cover with plastic wrap
        and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, about 3 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place burgers on the grate and cook, turing occasionally, until firm and
        cooked to your desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the center should read between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 degrees
        C). Let burgers rest for a few minutes before serving.
